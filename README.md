For my capstone project, I will be developing a web based Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Master’s Guide. 
The goal of this application is to allow the dungeon master to keep track of campaign details 
while also helping manage player information such as changes to statistics and initiative order. 
The application will consist of various categories where the user can input information, which will then be stored in a database associated with that category. 
Examples of these categories include locations, factions, NPCs, and enemies. Information stored in the database will be displayed when the user selects a category from the menu.

Data input must be controlled, organized, and displayed in a clear and structured manner. 
Each category will contain multiple input fields designed to store different types of information. 
For example, a location entry will include an input field for a general description of the area, 
a field indicating how many NPCs and enemies are present, and another field listing all items located in that area.

The user interface of the application will be divided into multiple sections. At the top of the page will be a small header displaying the website name and logo, 
along with a hamburger icon that opens a slide-out menu from the right side of the screen. This menu will display the different categories mentioned earlier. 
When the user selects a category, the main content area on the left side of the screen will split horizontally into two sections. 
The top section will display any information currently stored in the database for that category, while the bottom section will contain the input fields used to add or edit information. 
A minimize feature will allow the user to collapse the bottom section when needed, and the top section will include a scrollbar for navigating larger amounts of data.

The application will also include a dungeon map creation feature, which will be accessible from the same menu as the other categories. When the dungeon map editor is selected, the screen will be divided into three sections. 
The largest, top section will display the dungeon map itself, where the user can construct the map using simple 2D primitive shapes. The user will be able to add shapes by right-clicking and selecting from a list of predefined primitives. 
Each shape will represent a room within the dungeon. Primitive shapes can also be combined into a custom shape that behaves as a single room, similar to how tools like TinkerCAD combine multiple objects into one. 
Any unmodified shape will automatically function as a room. When a room is selected, the second panel will display any information associated with that room. The third panel will contain the input fields used to enter or modify room details. 
This feature is intended to allow DM’s to design dungeon layouts while storing information such as room descriptions and the items, enemies, or NPCs located within each room.

The application will also include a dedicated section for player and enemy information, providing quick access to data a dungeon master may need during gameplay. 
This section will be accessible from the same slide-out menu as the other categories. When the player information option is selected, a list of all player and enemy data will appear in the right-side menu. 
On the left side of the screen, a list of player names will be displayed along with an input field labeled “initiative.” This input field will accept numeric values from 1 to 20. 
These values can be changed or overwritten at any time and will be saved to the database, allowing the dungeon master to resume combat if a session ends in the middle of an engagement. 
When the user clicks on a player or enemy name in the slide out menu the left side of the screen will split horizontally like the other categories information screen, and this will behave the same say as the categories. 
The player information will be displayed on the top section and the input fields will be on the bottom section. The players information tab will have a quick reference that shows initiatives when you first click on player information, 
and it will have a more detailed player information if you click on the player name in the right slide out menu.

In conclusion, this project aims to provide a dungeon master with a centralized quick access tool for managing campaigns and player details and encounter information in a way that supports quick and smooth gameplay. 
This application is also designed to help beginner Dungeon Masters organize and build their own unique campaigns. Your own imagination is the limit here.
